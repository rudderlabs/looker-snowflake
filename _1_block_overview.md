## Block Overview

[RudderStack](https://rudderstack.com/) is an open-source Segment alternative for collecting, storing and routing customer event data securely to dozens of analytics tools and data warehouses. It is enterprise-ready, and provides a powerful transformation framework to process your event data on the fly.

Using RudderStack's libraries, companies can easily track and route their customer data for analysis in Looker. 

RudderStack offers the following features to the customers through their free or enterprise plan:

- [**Integrations**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/destinations-guides): RudderStack currently supports over 40 marketing or analytics tools. Rather than manually configuring and integrating the tracking code for each tool, customers can track their data at once using RudderStack's event collection libraries and SDKs. Once the destination is configured and enabled in the dashboard, RudderStack automatically starts capturing and sending the event data to the destination in a format that it expects.

- [**Sources**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/sources-guides): RudderStack's enterprise plan currently supports Customer.io as a source, which collects and routes the customer event data directly to RudderStack. This data can, in turn, be transformed and further routed to the customers' preferred destination for further processing or analytics.

- [**Data Warehouses**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/data-warehouse-integration-guides): RudderStack supports data warehouse integrations for Snowflake, Redshift, PostgreSQL and Google BigQuery. Customers can load their customer event data or data from their cloud apps into these connected warehouses and start analyzing them in Looker.
